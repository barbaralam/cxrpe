There is no evidence of focal lesions.  There is no evidence\nof intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation.  The gallbladder is within\nnormal limits.\n\nPancreas: The pancreas has normal attenuation throughout, without evidence of\nfocal lesions or pancreatic ductal dilatation. There is no peripancreatic\nstranding.\n\nSpleen: Trace amount of crescentic perihepatic hyperdensity is noted,\nsuggestive of small subcapsular and\/or perisplenic hematoma (601:45).  In\naddition, there is trace amount of perihepatic fluid.\n\nAdrenals:  The right and left adrenal glands are normal in size and shape.\n\nUrinary: The kidneys are of normal and symmetric size with normal nephrogram. \nThere is no evidence of focal renal lesions or hydronephrosis. There is no\nperinephric abnormality.\n\nGastrointestinal: The stomach is unremarkable.  Small bowel loops demonstrate\nnormal caliber, wall thickness, and enhancement throughout.  The colon and\nrectum are within normal limits.  Rectal probe is identified.  The appendix is\nnormal (5:64).  There is no free intraperitoneal fluid or free air.\n\nPelvis:\n\nThe urinary bladder is decompressed with nondependent gas, likely related to\nFoley placement.  Distal ureters are unremarkable.  There is no free fluid in\nthe pelvis.\n\nReproductive organs: The prostate and seminal vesicles are unremarkable.\n\nLymph nodes: There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy.  There\nis no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.\n\nVascular: There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm.  Moderate atherosclerotic\ndisease is noted.\n\nBones and soft tissues:There is mild degenerative changes of the bilateral hip\njoints.  There is fusion of the bilateral sacroiliac joints and ossification\nof the anterior longitudinal ligaments, suggestive of inflammatory ankylosing\nspondylitis.  7 mm intramuscular lipoma is noted along the lateral abdominal\nmusculature (05:53). Comminuted fracture of the sternum and imaged anterior\nribs from first through sixth bilaterally are likely sequela of resuscitation\nefforts. There is diffuse ossification of the anterior longitudinal ligament,\nmost consistent with DISH.\n\n\nIMPRESSION:\n\n\n\n1. Likely sequela of aspiration and resuscitation efforts in the chest,\nincluding multiple bilateral rib fractures and sternal fracture.  Possibly\nvery tiny focal left pneumothorax.\n2. No evidence of acute pulmonary embolism.\n3. Small subcapsular\/perisplenic splenic hematoma and possible\nsubcapsular\/perihepatic hepatic hematoma.  Otherwise, no acute intra-abdominal\nor intrapelvic abnormalities."

There is no\nevidence of penetrating atherosclerotic ulcer or aortic arch atheroma present.\n\nThe pulmonary arteries are well opacified to the subsegmental level, with no\nevidence of filling defect within the main, right, left, lobar or segmental\npulmonary arteries.  Assessment of subsegmental pulmonary arteries is somewhat\nlimited due to respiratory motion.  Enlargement of the main pulmonary artery\nto 3.4 cm suggests pulmonary arterial hypertension.\n\nThe thyroid gland is enlarged, heterogeneous, and contains multiple small\nnodules.  There is no axillary, supraclavicular, mediastinal, or hilar\nlymphadenopathy by CT size criteria.  The heart is enlarged.  There is no\npericardial effusion.  Aortic annular and coronary artery calcifications are\npresent.\n\nThere is no evidence of pericardial effusion.  There is no pleural effusion.\n\nAirways are patent to the segmental level.  Mucus plugging is seen within\nseveral bilateral lower lobe subsegmental bronchi.  Mild dependent and\nlingular atelectasis is present.  A 7 x 3 mm ovoid perifissural nodule is\npresent in the left upper lobe (3:38), which may represent an intrapulmonary\nlymph node.

A 7 mm ovoid perifissural nodule in the left upper lobe may represent an\nintrapulmonary lymph node.  Recommend attention on followup.\n\n4.  Enlarged, heterogeneous, multinodular thyroid gland.  Recommend further\nevaluation with non-urgent thyroid ultrasound, if this has not already been\nperformed.\n\n5.  Enlargement of the main pulmonary artery suggests pulmonary arterial\nhypertension."
