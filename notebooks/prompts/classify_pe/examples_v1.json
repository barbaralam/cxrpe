No mediastinal mass.\n\nPleural spaces: No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.\n\nLungs\/airways: Mild centrilobular emphysema.  Mild right apical scarring. \nThere is mixed consolidative and ground-glass opacities in the superior\nsegment of the left upper lobe.  A 3 mm pulmonary nodule abuts the mediastinum\nin the right upper lobe (series 3, image 112).  There is a 2 mm micronodule in\nthe anterior right upper lobe (series 3, image 100).  There is a 2 mm right\napical ground-glass micronodule (series 3, image 52).  There is a small\ncalcified granuloma in the right apex (series 3, image 56).  There is subtle\nperipheral ground-glass opacities in the anterior left lower lobe (series 3,\nimages 109 through 112).  There is diffuse mild bronchial wall thickening with\nscattered subsegmental mucous impaction suggesting chronic airways disease.\n\nBase of neck: Visualized portions of the base of the neck show no abnormality.\n\nAbdomen: Small hiatal hernia.\n\nBones\/soft tissues: No suspicious osseous abnormality is seen.? There is no\nacute fracture.  There is probably a small right subscapular elastofibroma.\n\n\nIMPRESSION:\n\n\n\n1. Extensive left upper, left lower, and right upper lobar pulmonary emboli. \nNo convincing evidence of right heart strain.\n2. Mixed consolidative and ground-glass opacities in the superior segment of\nthe right lower lobe could reflect sequela of infarction despite no definite\nthrombus.  Alternatively, infection or aspiration are considerations.\n3. Probable early evidence of infarction in the anterior left lower lobe.\n4. Scattered pulmonary nodules measure up to 4 mm. For incidentally detected\nsingle solid pulmonary nodule smaller than 6 mm, no CT follow-up is\nrecommended in a low-risk patient, and an optional CT in 12 months is\nrecommend in a high-risk patient."

There is no\nevidence of penetrating atherosclerotic ulcer or aortic arch atheroma present.\n\nThe pulmonary arteries are well opacified to the subsegmental level, with no\nevidence of filling defect within the main, right, left, lobar or segmental\npulmonary arteries.  Assessment of subsegmental pulmonary arteries is somewhat\nlimited due to respiratory motion.  Enlargement of the main pulmonary artery\nto 3.4 cm suggests pulmonary arterial hypertension.\n\nThe thyroid gland is enlarged, heterogeneous, and contains multiple small\nnodules.  There is no axillary, supraclavicular, mediastinal, or hilar\nlymphadenopathy by CT size criteria.  The heart is enlarged.  There is no\npericardial effusion.  Aortic annular and coronary artery calcifications are\npresent.\n\nThere is no evidence of pericardial effusion.  There is no pleural effusion.\n\nAirways are patent to the segmental level.  Mucus plugging is seen within\nseveral bilateral lower lobe subsegmental bronchi.  Mild dependent and\nlingular atelectasis is present.  A 7 x 3 mm ovoid perifissural nodule is\npresent in the left upper lobe (3:38), which may represent an intrapulmonary\nlymph node.  Few small nonspecific scattered areas of ground-glass attenuation\nare seen within the bilateral lungs.\n\nLimited images of the upper abdomen are unremarkable.\n\nNo lytic or blastic osseous lesion suspicious for malignancy is identified.\n\n\nIMPRESSION:\n\n\n\n1.  No evidence of pulmonary embolism to the segmental level or aortic\nabnormality.  Assessment of subsegmental pulmonary arteries is limited due to\nrespiratory motion.\n\n2.  Mucus plugging is seen within several bilateral lower lobe subsegmental\nbronchi.  Slight airway wall thickening is consistent with inflammation.\n\n3.  A 7 mm ovoid perifissural nodule in the left upper lobe may represent an\nintrapulmonary lymph node.  Recommend attention on followup.\n\n4.  Enlarged, heterogeneous, multinodular thyroid gland.  Recommend further\nevaluation with non-urgent thyroid ultrasound, if this has not already been\nperformed.\n\n5.  Enlargement of the main pulmonary artery suggests pulmonary arterial\nhypertension."
